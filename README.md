# Solar Production Forecast — Pipeline + Streamlit Dashboard

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts solar power output based on historical weather and solar production data. The model’s predictions are integrated into an interactive dashboard.



Quick start

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```cmd
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Ensure `solar_data_cleaned.csv` is in the project root (generated by `week-1.ipynb`).

3. Run the Streamlit app:

```cmd
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
